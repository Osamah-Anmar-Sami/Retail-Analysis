# Retail-Analysis
This Is My Graduate Project As A Fellow At Training And Competitions By Correlation One.

# Overview
This project focuses on Data Curation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using python and Tableau. The data curation process includes handling missing values, creating new features, converting data types, renaming columns, and removing duplicates. For EDA, various analytical techniques are applied, including Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate Analysis, to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset.
